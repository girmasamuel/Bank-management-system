# Bank Management System

## Overview
The **Bank Management System** serves as an educational tool to demonstrate core data structures and algorithms used in banking systems. By focusing on console-based interactions, it emphasizes fundamental programming concepts, making it suitable for students learning Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).

## Features

- **Account Management**
  - Create, update, and delete customer accounts.
  - Store essential details like account type and balance.

- **Transaction Processing**
  - handle deposits and
  - handle withdrawals.

- **Reporting**
  - Generate simple reports to track account balances and transaction histories.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: CPP
- **Data Structures**: Linked list,Binary tree,stack
- **Environment**: Command Line Interface (CLI)

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17
- cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)

## Installation
#### LINUX

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/girmasamuel/Bank-management-system.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Bank-management-system
3. create **build** folder in the root directory of project
4. Navigate to the created build directory
    ```bash
    cd build

5. run
    ```bash
    cmake ..

6. create excutable file
    ```bash
    make

7. just finished run the excutable
    ```bash
    ./start_system
